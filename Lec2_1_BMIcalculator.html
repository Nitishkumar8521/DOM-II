<!-- BMI Calculator
Create an application which calculates BMI (Body Mass Index)
Your app should have 2 input boxes
Take weight in kgs from user
Take height in meters from user
Based on entered height and weight calculate BMI of that person
Here is the formula for manually calculating BMI  BMI = (weight) / (height * height)
From the obtained BMI result, display whether the person is
UnderWeight - bmi <= 18.4
Normal Weight - bmi >= 18.5 && bmi <= 24.9
Overweight - bmi >= 25 && bmi <= 29.9
Obese - bmi >= 30 -->
